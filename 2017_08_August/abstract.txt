Reproducibility and high-performance computing with drake

The issue of reproducibility is at the forefront of the R and Statistics community buzz, but there are glaring holes in the conversation and the landscape. Most current talks and tools focus on scientific replicability, code annotation, and version control, and they miss the most crucial part of reproducible data analysis: the promise that the alleged results really do match the code. Drake helps keep this promise by tracking the relationships among the components of the analysis, a rare and effective approach that also saves time. And with multiple parallel computing options that switch on auto-magically, drake is also a convenient and powerful high-performance computing solution. Drake is published on CRAN, and you can follow the development at https://github.com/wlandau-lilly/drake.
