Reproducibility and high-performance computing with drake

There is room to improve the conversation and the landscape of reproducibility in the R and Statistics communities. At a more basic level than scientific replicability, literate programming, and version control, reproducibility carries an implicit promise that the alleged results of an analysis really do match the code. Drake helps keep this promise by tracking the relationships among the components of the analysis, a rare and effective approach that also saves time. And with multiple parallel computing options that switch on auto-magically, drake is also a convenient and powerful high-performance computing solution. Drake is published on CRAN, and you can follow the development at https://github.com/wlandau-lilly/drake.
