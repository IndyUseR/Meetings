# Suggested Topics for IndyUseR meetups

Below is a list of some suggested topics for the meetup. If you have ideas for talks or want to give a talk, you can either send us a message in the [IndyUseR](http://www.meetup.com/Indy-useR-Group/) meetup page or you can add it as an issue in this github page. 

This meetup group is very informal and so you don't have to be an expert to give a talk. Talk on anything related to R is welcome. Some ideas are talking about a problem you are working on, something fun you did, a short tutorial etc.
